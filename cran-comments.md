## Resubmission
Re-submitting in response to email from Martina Schmirl regarding directional quotes for package names, software names and API names in DESCRIPTION. 

I have added changed all backtick quotes with single quotes in the DESCRIPTION file for 'fitzRoy', 'AFL Tables', 'Footy Wire', and 'The Squiggle'.

I have also made sure to reset user options in the vignette `mens-stats.Rmd` as per Martina's comments.
